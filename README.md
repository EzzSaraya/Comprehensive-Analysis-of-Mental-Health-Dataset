# Comprehensive Analysis of Mental Health Dataset 🧠📊

A data science project that performs an in-depth exploratory and predictive analysis on a mental health dataset to gain insights into factors affecting mental health and build classification models.

> This repository contains a  notebook that explores the dataset, performs feature engineering, visualization, and builds predictive models.

## 📌 Dataset

The analysis uses a publicly available **Mental Health Dataset** from Kaggle — containing demographic, behavioral, and survey responses about mental well-being. Typical features include age, gender, workplace/school environment, symptoms, and mental health outcomes.  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jiscecseaiml/mental-health-dataset

## 🧠 Project Goals

- Understand the structure and patterns in mental health data  
- Visualize correlations between features and mental health outcomes  
- Train and evaluate machine learning models for classification  
- Compare model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score

## 🚀 Analysis Workflow

1. **Loading the Dataset**  
   Load the CSV dataset and inspect basic properties — missing values, distributions, and data types.

2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
   - Handle missing/erroneous entries  
   - Encode categorical variables  
   - Scale/normalize continuous features

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Demographic breakdowns (gender, age groups)  
   - Mental health condition distributions  
   - Feature correlations (heatmaps, pairplots)

4. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Creating derived variables  
   - Handling class imbalance (oversampling/undersampling)

5. **Model Building & Evaluation**  
   - Train classifiers (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost)  
   - Evaluate using metrics and confusion matrices  
   - Compare results across models
